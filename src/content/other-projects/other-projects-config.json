        "description": "In our published review in the Cureus Journal of Medical Science, we delved into the complexities of treating post-surgery brain metastases, emphasizing the challenges in determining optimal timing for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Our research explored the intricate relationship between preoperative tumor volume, cavity size, and SRS timing, identifying key variables for consideration. Our goal is to enhance outcomes and optimize local control, survival, and quality of life for patients undergoing this critical intervention.",

Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a _Full Stack Software Engineer_ based out of New York City.

 My journey into the world of coding is fueled by a love for software development. I'm well acquainted with various *frontend* and *backend* frameworks, as well as different *databases* . I have always been a firm believer in the human element of design and knowing your audience. Therefore, I strive to create simple, functional and impactful user experiences. I primarily code in **Javascript** and **Ruby**. 

Outside the coding realm, I'm a dedicated language learner, exploring both the intricacies of coding languages and the beauty of spoken languages. As a gamer, photographer, and traveler, I'm always seeking new experiences. Let's connect, collaborate, and embark on exciting journeys together
